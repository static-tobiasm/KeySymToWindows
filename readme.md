## How to convert X11/Unix Keysym values to Windows keys and characters
This solution is only to show you a way to how convert from Keysym to Windows. It is done by a mapping table to make sure it supports all defined Keysym to Unicode mappings. ASCII characters are easy, newer Unicode characters are easy, but there is the in-between part. I haven't seen a complete solution, therefore I came up with this simple mapping approach. The "hard" work went into defining the mappings.

Enjoy!
